# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to **Tomshley Base Containers**.

This project is part of **Tomshley LLC's OSS and IP strategy** and is intentionally opinionated.

## Philosophy

- Alpine-first
- Minimal images
- Clear layering and separation of concerns
- Buildx + Bake as first-class tooling

Changes that increase complexity, size, or scope without strong justification are unlikely to be accepted.

## What Contributions Are Welcome

- Bug fixes
- Security improvements
- Build reproducibility improvements
- Documentation improvements
- New images that clearly fit the layering model

## What Is Out of Scope

- Adding unnecessary tools to base images
- Introducing additional Linux distributions without discussion
- Turning images into application examples
- CI logic changes unrelated to image building

## Process

1. Open an issue describing the change
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a focused pull request
4. Keep commits clean and scoped

Tomshley LLC reserves final decision-making authority on all contributions.
